this program uses imgui for the user interface, and imgui-sfml to be able to use it with sfml

signal analysis software, mainly aimed for reverse engineering signals from SDRs, allows you to zoom
into signals as much as you'd like, has a frequency waterfall window, also has a window with time/signal
that has the raw data from the wav file

you can separate frequencies and scan them independently using the time/signal display

possibility to smooth the signal instead of having a jagged drawing

timescale that can move around and change the size (to make decoding signals easier)

automatic signal decoding, future far goal

ability to write the structure of the signal and decode straight from there, also far future goal
