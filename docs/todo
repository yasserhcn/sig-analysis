- add logging, both verbose and normal to be able to track issues
- refactor code and use the new code structure

- separate ui/window dpending on what display you're currently looking at
    each tab class should have a drawUI function that deals with it
    it's a virtual function from the parent class
- add windowing to the fft, and make the wnidow scale or idk resizeable (idk check baudline)
- add an amplitude average graph to the ui
- add ability to select separate frequencies and ifft them to see their waveform
    should work with LPF and HPF (those are filters) and an ifft that puts it to
    a temporary storage area (preferably the data class)
- add ability to select multiple frequencies and be able to quick swap between them
    no matter what tab you're in, they're global
    perhaps the data class keep track of them (that's gonna take a whole bunch of memory)
- add ability to do operations on those waveforms (idk what it'll be usefull for but maybe
    it'll work when dealing with IQ data or something similar)
